### Python Chinese English Comparison

Create an instance and assign attributes

It is equivalent to creating a series of attributes equivalent to instance for testcase

相当于给testcase创建一系列等同于instance的属性

The purpose of testing is to protect other code blocks

Store a question and prepare for storing the answer 

Launching unit-tests with arguments python -m unit-test(使用参数python -m unit-test启动单元测试 )

passable test -->  reptile(爬虫)

Unit tests and test cases -->  Key-value pair 

separate -->  separator

JSON --> JavaScript Object Notation ------>placeholder

Calculate how many words the file contains 

text -----> we will take a test for today`s text

Analyze the text  <==> text analysis

a simple attempt to simulate the calculator

Use exceptions to avoid crashes 

zero division error

Create a list containing the contents of each line of the file

`read()` returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file 

The keyword `with` will close the file when it is no longer needed --> with-as loop strcture

when creating a subclass, the super class must be in the current file.

Properties that need to be modified <==> attributes that need to be modified

python standard library

Custom workflow

This import method is not recommended ==> from module_name import *

### Python English Short Sentences

The only difference between the test class and the test function is that you need to create an instance before the test class

----

In this example, the use of try-except-else code block provides two important advantages, to avoid allowing users to see the traceback; so that the program can continue to analyze and find other files. 

-----

For the method of the supclass, as long as it does not conform to the behavior of the instance simulated by the subclass. It can be overridden, and a method can be defined in the subclass, that is, it has the same name as the method of the supclass to be overridden. In this way, Python will not consider the supclass method, but only pay attention to the corresponding method you define in the subclass.

----

Guidelines for functions writing:

- When specifying default values for parameters, there should be no spaces on both sides of the equal sign. 
- This Convention should also be followed for keyword-arguments in function calls.
- If a program or module contains multiple functions, use two empty lines to separate adjacent functions.

----

When the default values are specified for the parameter, there should be no spaces on the sides of the equals, and this agreement should also be followed for the keyword-arguments in the function call.

If a program or module contains multiple functions, two adjacent blank functions can be used to separate the adjacent functions.

----

The best way to quote is to import only the functions you need, or import the entire module and use the <u>period notation</u>`句号表示法`.

The best practice for references is either`两者中的任一个` to import only the functions you need to use, or to import the entire module and use a period representation.

The best way to do this is to import only the functions you need, or import the entire module and use the period notation.

引用的最佳的做法是，要么只导入你需要使用的函数，要么导入整个模块并使用句点表示法

----

The module and the files that need to call the functions in the module should be placed in the same directory.模块与需要调用模块内函数的文件要放在同一目录下

----

The `import` statement allows the code in the module to be used in the currently running program file.

----

I have a dog, and it`s name is floret.

----

Function allows your program to be divided into multiple small parts, each part is responsible for completing a specific task.

----

if you could visit one place in the world, where would you go?

----
