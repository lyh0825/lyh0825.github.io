the speed of operation is not calculated by time but by the number of steps

time complexity

cucumber  ==  elderberry

the based data structure：array

Why data structure is important

Sorting Algorithm

Presenting digital data on the world map

If the specified country is not found, return none

According to the specified country, return the two-letter country code used by pygal

Get the first two letters as an identifier

binary(10) --> decimal(02)

Convert string to integer value

Nest dictionaries in the list

Making a world population map: json format

Line transparency

Color the drawing area

In the same code block, you need to keep the axis consistent when drawing multiple charts

Plot another data series

Cover a longer period of time

a common use case:一个常见的用例

Date tick-labels often overlap, so it is useful to rotate them and right align them.  Also, a common use case is a number of subplots with shared x-axis where the x-axis is date data.  The tick-labels are often long, and it helps to rotate them on the bottom subplot and turn them off on other subplots, as well as turn off x-labels.

> 日期刻度标签通常会重叠，因此旋转它们并使其右对齐很有用。 同样，一个常见的用例是具有共享x轴的多个子图，其中x轴是日期数据。 tick-label通常很长，它有助于在底部子图上旋转它们，并在其他子图上将其关闭，以及关闭x-label。

According to the original data, here should be modified to`%Y/%m%d`

Convert string to date object

Draw the chart based on the data

Chart temperature

If you traverse the document directly, you start traversing from the row content |

Get the maximum temperature from the file

Extract and read data

Print file header and its position

Return the contents of one line of the file

Can be inherited and called

`install`:安装 --> `download`:下载

Quickly create a list

Color mapping target data

learning target


Remove duplicate elements

Throw two dice with different faces at the same time

Send an interactive message

Count the number of occurrences of value in the list

Represents the class of a dice

It has six sides by default

Returns a random value between 1 and the number of faces on the dice

Requirement already satisfied

Use `pygal` to simulate a dice roll

Units are inches

Set the size of the drawing window

Increase points

Redraw the start and end points

Highlight the start and end

`cm=`Data that needs color mapping	`cmp=`plt.cm.Colors

if conditional statement

As long as the program is active, it will continue to simulate random walks

simulate multiple random walks

Determine the direction of travel and the distance to travel in this direction

Refuse to stand still --> choose direction

Calculate the x and y values of the next point

Calculate all points included in a random walk

Keep walking until the list reaches the specified length

All random walks start at (0, 0)

A class that generates random walk data

i/o conflict

You must replace plt.show with plt.savefig or the saved chart will be blank

Automatically save the chart

use color-map `使用颜色映射`

*c* argument looks like a single numeric RGB or RGBA sequence, which should be avoided as value-mapping will have precedence in case its length matches with *x* & *y*.  Please use the *color* keyword-argument or provide a 2D array with a single row if you intend to specify the same RGB or RGBA value for all points.

`c *参数看起来像一个单一的RGB或RGBA数字序列，应避免使用它，因为在其长度与* x *和* y *匹配的情况下，值映射将具有优先级。 如果要为所有点指定相同的RGB或RGBA值，请使用* color *关键字参数或将2D数组与单行一起提供。`

Custom color: define/design the color by yourself

Delete the outline of the data point

Automatic calculation data

Use scatter to draw a series of points

Use scatter to draw and style scatter plots
