# English Study Three

## COVID19

`covid-19` epidemic forecast

Research on data-driven evaluation and prediction modeling of the development and spread of the new crown epidemic

## Implement Data Structure By Python

Book structure  ==> review

## Data Structure

### Graph

Graph database 

Breadth first search

depth first search

Directed graph  ==  Undirected graph

### Binary Tree

Diagram/graph connecting everything

Only trees created with randomly shuffled data can be more balanced. If all inserted data is sorted, then the binary tree is out of balance.

If there are two sub nodes, the value of one sub node must be less than the sup node, and the value of the other sub node must be greater than the sup node.

### Quick Select

Binary tree that makes everything faster

Doubly linked list

Worst case

Node-based data structure

Store data and next physical address

### Recursion

Recursion in the eyes of computers

Fast recursive algorithm

### QUEUE

`Queue: first in, first out[FIFO]`

The queue is also an ideal tool for processing asynchronous requests-it can ensure that the requests are executed in the order in which they are received. In addition, it is also often used to simulate real-world scenarios where things need to be processed in an orderly manner, such as airplanes waiting in line for take-off, patients waiting in line to see a doctor

insert data at the end

read data at the begin

remove data at the begin

### STACK

insert data at the end 

read data at the end

remove data at the end

`Queue: last in, first out[LIFO]`

Stack: all operations at the end of stack(STACK TOP)

When the order of data processing is opposite to the order of acceptance (LIFO), the stack is just right, like the "undo" action of a word processor, or the function call of a network application, it should be implemented with a stack

Stacks are rarely used in scenarios that require long-term retention of data, but are often used in various algorithms for processing temporary data

rules to follow: last in, first out

The end of the stack is called the top of the stack

The beginning of the stack is called the bottom of the stack

Its operations are at the end of the data structure

So far, our discussion of data structure has focused on its performance

Use stacks and queues to construct smart code

### Hash Table

Hash table in two ways: one is the same value as the Value of Key, the general structure of this case we call for the Set (collection); and if the Key and Value corresponding to the content is not the same, then we call it One case is Map, which is commonly known as a collection of key-value pairs.

The ratio of the amount of data to the number of grids is called the load factor ==> (0.7)

The golden rule to avoid conflicts and save space: add ten grids for every seven elements added

Alphabet 

multiply list

A dictionary of fun and profitable synonyms

hash tables ==> dictionary (data structure)

Intersection

Average situation

The role of `O()`

The two exchange positions

## Sorting Algorithm

### Select Sort

The two exchange positions

Compare the remaining values with the extracted values, find the minimum value and assign its index to the minimum value

Exchange the position of the extracted value and the minimum value according to the index 

### Bubble Sort

The essence of the sorting algorithm is a loop, so you only need to focus on the first loop.
