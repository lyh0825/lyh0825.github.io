# Implement Data Structure

## Part 1 Introduction

### Short Sentences

Client server software:客户机-服务器软件
Shared file system:共享文件系统

A complete binary tree can be represented by a list instead of using ‘list nested list’ or ‘nodes and references’

The hierarchical nature of the tree derives`generate` an important property, that is, part of the tree (subtree) can be moved to another position as a whole without affecting the layers below.

Implement the tree as a recursive data structure

Implement priority queue with stack

Hash Mapping Relations --> deal with conflicts

Open addressing <==> Linear detection 

If there is no termination condition, it will enter an endless loop, the program will crash, and the stack will overflow

Complex recursion problem 

Calculate the sum of a column of numbers

Three principles of recursion

The base case recursive algorithm must change the state and move closer to the base case

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while getting the str of an object

Each element has a position relative to the other elements

lambda variable : variable `operation code block`

Calculate execution time

The realization of abstract data types is called data structure

Understand the pre-order, middle-order, and post-order expressions 

By running the code 10,000 times to find the time required for each method, we conclude that the best method is list(range())

python data structure performance:`数据结构的性能`

Realize the inventory plan 

Examples of heterologous word detection

The number in the computer is expressed in binary, and the leftmost bit is generally used to indicate whether the number is positive or negative. In this case, the number is a signed integer. If the leftmost bit is not used to indicate positive or negative, but is connected with the following to indicate an integer, then it cannot be distinguished whether the number is positive or negative, and it can only be a positive number, which is an unsigned integer.

Comparison with None performed with equality operators 

Instance attribute pinA defined outside __init__

Lowercase variable imported as non lowercase :`小写变量导入为非小写`

categorical cross entropy ：`分类交叉熵`

Remove redundant parentheses 

row --> 行		column |--列

hyper-parameter: parameters set manually

`Relu`:rectified linear units layer

The choice depends on the big data and full connected layer based on back propagation.(Convolution Kernel)

The selection of the convolution kernel is not manual operation, but mechanical learning with the help of big data. The key lies in the loss function of the fully connected layer and the principle of back propagation.

Rectified Linear Units layer == Modified linear unit(Relu layer)

back propagation --> down sampling

Modified linear unit(Relu layer)

`Relu activation function`--beneficial to--> Gradient descent 

The relu function turns negative numbers in the feature map to zero

Activation function

The marginal area will be processed with zero padding

Ability to reduce the data volume of the feature map while retaining the original data

Convolution kernel

Convolutional Neural Network：`CNN`

gcd: greatest common divisor

Euclid Algorithm:`欧几里得算法`

```python
def gcd(m, n):
    while m % n != 0:
        oldm = m
        oldn = n

        m = oldn
        n = oldm % oldn
    return n
```

A common example is to implement a data type of construct class fraction
